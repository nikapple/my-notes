# Plant UML

- PlantUML is used to draw UML diagrams, using a simple and human readable **text description**.
Be careful, because it does not prevent you from drawing inconsistent diagrams (such as having two classes inheriting from each other, for example). So it's more a **drawing tool** than a modeling tool.
